# ðŸ“Œ Day 1:2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign

**LeetCode Link:** [Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-tasks-you-can-assign/description/)

---

## ðŸ§© Problem

You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).
Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.
Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.

### Example:

```
Input: tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1
Output:  3
Explanation:
We can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:
- Give the magical pill to worker 0.
- Assign worker 0 to task 2 (0 + 1 >= 1)
- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (3 >= 2)
- Assign worker 2 to task 0 (3 >= 3)
```

## âœ… Code (Python)

```python
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxTaskAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks);
        Arrays.sort(workers);
        int low = 0, high = Math.min(tasks.length, workers.length);

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high + 1) / 2;
            if (canAssign(tasks, workers, pills, strength, mid)) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

    private boolean canAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength, int taskCount) {
        Deque<Integer> boosted = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int w = workers.length - 1;
        int freePills = pills;

        for (int t = taskCount - 1; t >= 0; t--) {
            int task = tasks[t];

            if (!boosted.isEmpty() && boosted.peekFirst() >= task) {
                boosted.pollFirst();
            } else if (w >= 0 && workers[w] >= task) {
                w--;
            } else {
                while (w >= 0 && workers[w] + strength >= task) {
                    boosted.addLast(workers[w--]);
                }
                if (boosted.isEmpty() || freePills == 0) {
                    return false;
                }
                boosted.pollLast();
                freePills--;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
