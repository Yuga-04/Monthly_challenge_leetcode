**🔗 LeetCode Link:** [2273. Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-resultant-array-after-removing-anagrams/)

---

## 🧩 Problem Description

<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string array <code>words</code>, where <code>words[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</p>

<p>In one operation, select any index <code>i</code> such that <code>0 &lt; i &lt; words.length</code> and <code>words[i - 1]</code> and <code>words[i]</code> are <strong>anagrams</strong>, and <strong>delete</strong> <code>words[i]</code> from <code>words</code>. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.</p>

<p>Return <code>words</code> <em>after performing all operations</em>. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in <strong>any</strong> arbitrary order will lead to the same result.</p>

<p>An <strong>Anagram</strong> is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, <code>&quot;dacb&quot;</code> is an anagram of <code>&quot;abdc&quot;</code>.</p>

## 🧩 Examples

### ✨ Example 1

Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words = [&quot;abba&quot;,&quot;baba&quot;,&quot;bbaa&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> [&quot;abba&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:
- Since words[2] = &quot;bbaa&quot; and words[1] = &quot;baba&quot; are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [&quot;abba&quot;,&quot;baba&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;].
- Since words[1] = &quot;baba&quot; and words[0] = &quot;abba&quot; are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words[1].
  Now words = [&quot;abba&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;].
- Since words[2] = &quot;cd&quot; and words[1] = &quot;cd&quot; are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [&quot;abba&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;].
We can no longer perform any operations, so [&quot;abba&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;] is the final answer.</pre>

### ✨ Example 2

Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
No two adjacent strings in words are anagrams of each other, so no operations are performed.</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words[i].length &lt;= 10</code></li>
	<li><code>words[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>

## ✅ Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> removeAnagrams(String[] words) {
        int n = words.length;
        List<Map<Character, Integer>> freq = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String w : words) {
            Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
            for (char c : w.toCharArray())
                map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
            freq.add(map);
        }

        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        ans.add(words[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (!freq.get(i).equals(freq.get(i - 1)))
                ans.add(words[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
